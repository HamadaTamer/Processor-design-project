chatgpt approximation:

    Timeline for first & last instruction:

        Inst 1:

            IF@1 → ID@2–3 → EX@4–5 → MEM@6 → WB@7

        Inst 15:

            IF@29 → ID@30–31 → EX@32–33 → MEM@34 → WB@35

    Peak parallelism: up to 4 instructions “in flight” once the pipeline is full (e.g. by cycle 7).

So your simulator should run for 35 clock cycles, fetching at odd cycles up to cycle 29, then draining the pipeline through cycle 35.
